## Jets Project (Week 3 Skill Distillery)


### Overview

This is a **jets** *application* it takes data from a file named jets.txt and converts it to useable data. A menu you allows you to access and manipulate the jets data using a text menu. The main menu consists of 9 menu options with users inputting a number corresponding to their choice. The user input data is error checked against invalid input type. The user can list all jets, fly all jets, view fastest jet, view longest range jet, load all cargo jets, dogfight jets, add a jet to the fleet, and remove a jet from the fleet, and finally quit the program loop and exit.
